# Work Directory for Genome Comparison

This directory is empty to allow for a reproducible workflow outlined in the repository RMarkDown files.

Intermediate Files for the analysis are compressed and located in the directory [Intermediate_Files](/Comp/Intermediate_Files) to compare against those reproduced.

Final Outputs are in the [Output](/Output) directory.
